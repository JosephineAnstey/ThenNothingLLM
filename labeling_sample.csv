"“Why, do you think?” inquired Fagin, parrying the question. “Indeed I don’t know, sir,” replied Oliver. “Bah!” said the Jew, turning away with a disappointed countenance from
a close perusal of the boy’s face.",,
"And I do assure you, she’s the
dearest girl!--’

Mr. Micawber took an early opportunity, after that, of hinting, with the
utmost delicacy and ceremony, at the state of my affections. Nothing

he observed, could deprive him of the impression that his friend
Copperfield loved and was beloved.",,

"Sikes, reflectively, “if I’d only got that
young boy of Ned, the chimbley-sweeper’s! He kept him small on purpose,
and let him out by the job. But the father gets lagged; and then the
Juvenile Delinquent Society comes, and takes the boy away from a trade
where he was earning money, teaches him to read and write, and in time
makes a ’prentice of him.",,
"“All,” replied the woman. Mr. Bumble drew a long breath, as if he were glad to find that the
story was over, and no mention made of taking the five-and-twenty
pounds back again; and now he took courage to wipe the perspiration
which had been trickling over his nose, unchecked, during the whole of
the previous dialogue.",,
"When all our tradesmen send into our
house any stuff they like, and the servants do what they like with
it, and I have no time to improve things if I knew how, and Ma don’t
care about anything, I should like to make out how Pa is to weather
the storm. I declare if I was Pa, I’d run away.”

“My dear!” said I, smiling. “Your papa, no doubt, considers his
family.”

“Oh, yes, his family is all very fine, Miss Summerson,” replied Miss
Jellyby; “but what comfort is his family to him?",,
"Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the
liveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with
coming, when she found herself so affectionately received. She saw

his formal civility was just what it had been; and he detained her some
minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her
family.",,

"CHAPTER XLII. AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE OF OLIVER’S, EXHIBITING DECIDED MARKS OF GENIUS,
BECOMES A PUBLIC CHARACTER IN THE METROPOLIS


Upon the night when Nancy, having lulled Mr. Sikes to sleep, hurried on
her self-imposed mission to Rose Maylie, there advanced towards London,
by the Great North Road, two persons, upon whom it is expedient that
this history should bestow some attention.",,
"‘So, Mr. Wickfield,’ said I, at last, ‘who is worth five hundred of
you--or me’; for my life, I think, I could not have helped dividing that
part of the sentence with an awkward jerk; ‘has been imprudent, has he,
Mr. Heep?’

‘Oh, very imprudent indeed, Master Copperfield,’ returned Uriah, sighing
modestly.",,
"Squod tacks out, all on one side, to execute the word of command;
and the trooper, having smoked his pipe, lays it by. Jo is brought
in. He is not one of Mrs.",,
"I thought
her, then, still more colourless and thin than when I had seen her last;
the flashing eyes still brighter, and the scar still plainer. Our meeting was not cordial. We had parted angrily on the last occasion;
and there was an air of disdain about her, which she took no pains to
conceal.",,
"Barkis. ‘Sweet hearts; no person walks with her!’

‘With Peggotty?’

‘Ah!’ he said. ‘Her.’

‘Oh, no.",,
"But of the loved,
revered, and honoured head, thou canst not turn one hair
to thy dread purposes, or make one feature odious. It is
not that the hand is heavy and will fall down when released;
it is not that the heart and pulse are still; but that the
hand WAS open, generous, and true; the heart brave, warm,
and tender; and the pulse a man's. Strike, Shadow, strike!",,
"Turveydrop. “Your qualities are not
shining, my dear child, but they are steady and useful. And to both
of you, my children, I would merely observe, in the spirit of a
sainted wooman on whose path I had the happiness of casting, I
believe, SOME ray of light, take care of the establishment, take care
of my simple wants, and bless you both!”

Old Mr.",,
"All that
he has of certainty will be expended when he is fully equipped. He
has exhausted his resources and is bound henceforward to the tree he
has planted.”

“Quite true that I have exhausted my present resources, and I am
quite content to know it. But what I have of certainty, sir,” said
Richard, “is not all I have.”

“Rick, Rick!” cried my guardian with a sudden terror in his manner,
and in an altered voice, and putting up his hands as if he would have
stopped his ears.",,
"how
would she have behaved?” were the questions with which she amused
herself. Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings’ party. “I assure
you, I feel it exceedingly,” said Lady Catherine; “I believe nobody
feels the loss of friends so much as I do.",,
"If I shrunk into
myself, hiding the disrespect I had undergone, it was because I honoured
you so much, and so much wished that you should honour me!’

‘Annie, my pure heart!’ said the Doctor, ‘my dear girl!’

‘A little more! a very few words more! I used to think there were so
many whom you might have married, who would not have brought such charge

"“Don’t look quite healthy though.”

Is not quite healthy, Mercury informs him. Suffers much from
headaches. Really?",,
"I do wonder what

that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of
one! There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought!",,
"He spoke long and earnestly, but what it was all
about Smee, who was rather stupid, did not know in the least. Anon he caught the word Peter. “Most of all,” Hook was saying passionately, “I want their captain,
Peter Pan.",,

listening, enchained by interest, with his poor wits calmly wandering
God knows where, upon the wings of hard words--I think of it as one of
the pleasantest things, in a quiet way, that I have ever seen. I feel
as if they might go walking to and fro for ever, and the world might
somehow be the better for it--as if a thousand things it makes a noise
about, were not one half so good for it, or me. Agnes was one of Mr.",,

the middle window.",,
"Matter of life or death. You know Lady
Dedlock?”

“Yes.”

“There has been a discovery there to-day. Family affairs have come
out.",,
"“Bless his sweet face!” said the old lady, looking after him. “I can’t
bear, somehow, to let him go out of my sight.”

At this moment, Oliver looked gaily round, and nodded before he turned
the corner. The old lady smilingly returned his salutation, and,
closing the door, went back to her own room.",,
"My father’s health was deeply
shaken by the horror of the recent events. Elizabeth was sad and
desponding; she no longer took delight in her ordinary occupations; all
pleasure seemed to her sacrilege toward the dead; eternal woe and tears she
then thought was the just tribute she should pay to innocence so blasted
and destroyed. She was no longer that happy creature who in earlier youth
wandered with me on the banks of the lake and talked with ecstasy of our
future prospects.",,
"The
business was therefore soon settled. He resigned all claim to assistance
in the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to
receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds. All connection
between us seemed now dissolved.",,
"A bell was rung as we drew up, and amidst the
sound of its deep voice in the still air, and the distant barking of
some dogs, and a gush of light from the opened door, and the smoking
and steaming of the heated horses, and the quickened beating of our
own hearts, we alighted in no inconsiderable confusion. “Ada, my love, Esther, my dear, you are welcome. I rejoice to see
you!",,
"The
labours I endured were no longer to be alleviated by the bright sun or
gentle breezes of spring; all joy was but a mockery which insulted my
desolate state and made me feel more painfully that I was not made for
the enjoyment of pleasure. “But my toils now drew near a close, and in two months from this time I
reached the environs of Geneva. “It was evening when I arrived, and I retired to a hiding-place among
the fields that surround it to meditate in what manner I should apply
to you.",,
"But
all pressing out of the room, in a crowd, to see what was the matter, we
found her lying on the hall floor. There was great alarm at first, until
it was found that she was in a swoon, and that the swoon was yielding
to the usual means of recovery; when the Doctor, who had lifted her
head upon his knee, put her curls aside with his hand, and said, looking
around:

‘Poor Annie! She’s so faithful and tender-hearted!",,
"As she looks at him so steadily and
coldly, he not only feels conscious that he has no guide in the least
perception of what is really the complexion of her thoughts, but also
that he is being every moment, as it were, removed further and
further from her. She will not speak, it is plain. So he must.",,
"I was unwilling to mention
her to you then, and I am now; but she is the person of whom I speak,
and with whom I think we should communicate. Do you understand?’

‘Too well, sir,’ he replied. We had sunk our voices, almost to a
whisper, and continued to speak in that tone.",,
"Jarndyce, shaking his head. “I
have said nothing to Ada, Esther. She has her friend and counsellor
always near.” And he laid his hand lovingly upon my head.",,
"“Did you see any of these pretty things, my dear?” said the Jew, laying
his hand upon it after a short pause. “Yes, sir,” replied Oliver. “Ah!” said the Jew, turning rather pale.",,
"I
am content.”

“I assure you,” said I, quite embarrassed by the mere idea of having
such an attendant, “that I keep no maid—”

“Ah, mademoiselle, but why not? Why not, when you can have one so
devoted to you! Who would be enchanted to serve you; who would be so
true, so zealous, and so faithful every day!",,
"Vholes, “that I never give hopes, sir. I told
you from the first, Mr. C., that I never give hopes.",,
"Leave all else
to time, truth, and steadfastness. If you do otherwise, you will do
wrong, and you will have made me do wrong in ever bringing you
together.”

A long silence succeeded. “Cousin Richard,” said Ada then, raising her blue eyes tenderly to
his face, “after what our cousin John has said, I think no choice is
left us.",,
"It’s quite enough that we let ’em
have live bodies. If you had kept the boy on gruel, ma’am, this would
never have happened.”

“Dear, dear!” ejaculated Mrs. Sowerberry, piously raising her eyes to
the kitchen ceiling: “this comes of being liberal!”

The liberality of Mrs.",,
"That is the woman,” replied Mr. Bumble, mindful of his wife’s
caution. “You think women never can keep secrets, I suppose?” said the matron,
interposing, and returning, as she spoke, the searching look of Monks.",,
"The Shadow


One of the first considerations which arose in the business mind of Mr. Lorry when business hours came round, was this:--that he had no right to
imperil Tellson’s by sheltering the wife of an emigrant prisoner under
the Bank roof. His own possessions, safety, life, he would have hazarded
for Lucie and her child, without a moment’s demur; but the great trust
he held was not his own, and as to that business charge he was a strict
man of business.",,

hoped his head would not be turned by it. “But if I had been a weak man,” he said. “Good heavens, if I had been a
weak man!”

aren’t you?”

“Full of remorse as ever, dearest!",,
"Gummidge, and motioned me with his head to obey him directly. I had
little doubt then, and I have less doubt now, that he would have knocked
me down without the least compunction, if I had hesitated. ‘Clara, my dear,’ he said, when I had done his bidding, and he walked me
into the parlour, with his hand still on my arm; ‘you will not be made
uncomfortable any more, I hope.",,

"Of the riders in the tumbrils, some observe these things, and all
things on their last roadside, with an impassive stare; others, with
a lingering interest in the ways of life and men. Some, seated with
drooping heads, are sunk in silent despair; again, there are some so
heedful of their looks that they cast upon the multitude such glances as
they have seen in theatres, and in pictures. Several close their eyes,
and think, or try to get their straying thoughts together.",,
"Bennet, as soon as they were out of
the house, “as ever I saw. He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us
all. I am prodigiously proud of him.",,

ringlets, and mine doesn’t go in ringlets at all; and I’m sure I can’t

puzzling it all is!",,
"Having dispatched which missive, Mr. Copperfield fell into a condition
of strong nervous agitation; and so remained until the day arrived. It was a great augmentation of my uneasiness to be bereaved, at this
eventful crisis, of the inestimable services of Miss Mills.",,
"Take your choice, but you must be satisfied
with only one. There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just
enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting
about pretty much. For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Mr.",,
"But I never
thought there was anything low and small in my keeping away from Joe,
because I knew she would be contemptuous of him. It was but a day gone,
and Joe had brought the tears into my eyes; they had soon dried, God
forgive me! soon dried.",,
"When these points were settled, and so far carried out as that I had
begun to work in earnest, it occurred to me that if I could retain my
bedroom in Barnard’s Inn, my life would be agreeably varied, while my
manners would be none the worse for Herbert’s society. Mr. Pocket did
not object to this arrangement, but urged that before any step could
possibly be taken in it, it must be submitted to my guardian.",,

duty?’

‘I have not worn anybody’s life away,’ said Peggotty, ‘I am thankful to
think!",,

“You will tell her I am here?” said Harry. “Of course,” replied Mrs. Maylie.",,
"Quick!” He

fast?”

“Double-locked and chained,” replied Crackit, who, with the other two
men, still remained quite helpless and bewildered. “The panels—are they strong?”

“And the windows too?”

“Yes, and the windows.”

courage to go up and knock.",,
"In the days when all these things are to be answered for,
I summon your brother, the worst of the bad race, to answer for them

finger yet raised, and as it dropped, he dropped with it, and I laid him

“Better,” Mr.",,

delightful, for Mrs. Darling put her hand to her heart and cried, “Oh,
why can’t you remain like this for ever!” This was all that passed
between them on the subject, but henceforth Wendy knew that she must

"He had said to the doctor, “Now, my dear
doctor, it is quite a delusion on your part to suppose that you
attend me for nothing. I am overwhelming you with money—in my
expansive intentions—if you only knew it!” And really (he said) he
meant it to that degree that he thought it much the same as doing it. If he had had those bits of metal or thin paper to which mankind
attached so much importance to put in the doctor’s hand, he would
have put them in the doctor’s hand.",,
"It began with the strange gentleman’s sitting down at the table,
drawing the candle to him, and looking over some entries in his

violent consternation.",,

very kindly to me and was extremely confidential, so much so that
sometimes she almost made me uncomfortable. I had no right, I knew

it was unreasonable; still, with all I could do, I could not quite
help it.",,

I made myself sob less and persuaded myself to be quiet by saying
very often, “Esther, now you really must! This WILL NOT do!” I
cheered myself up pretty well at last, though I am afraid I was

clearing the fire between the lower bars with the poker, and looking at
it; “she Ram-paged out, Pip.”

evening, he had been in divers companies in several public-houses, and
he had come back with myself and Mr. Wopsle.",,
"But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom
they had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walking
with an officer on the other side of the way. The officer was the very
Mr. Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire, and
he bowed as they passed.",,
"He lived with us during the whole term of his
stay,--which, I think, was something less than a month,--and his sister
and my aunt came to London to see him. Agnes and I parted from him
aboard-ship, when he sailed; and we shall never part from him more, on
earth. But before he left, he went with me to Yarmouth, to see a little tablet
I had put up in the churchyard to the memory of Ham.",,
"If I thought it, I should never be happy again. I
wouldn’t cut a boy off: no, not even Brittles here; not for all the
plate in the county, sir.”

“That’s not the point,” said the doctor, mysteriously. “Mr.",,
"Oh dear no! I am only the breadwinner, why should I
be coddled—why, why, why!”

“George,” Mrs. Darling entreated him, “not so loud; the servants will
hear you.” Somehow they had got into the way of calling Liza the
servants.",,
"Omer. He was as radiant, as if
his chair, his asthma, and the failure of his limbs, were the various
branches of a great invention for enhancing the luxury of a pipe. ‘I see more of the world, I can assure you,’ said Mr.",,
"I determined to make no resolutions until the
expiration of those three months, but to try. I lived in that valley,
and its neighbourhood, all the time. The three months gone, I resolved to remain away from home for some
time longer; to settle myself for the present in Switzerland, which was
growing dear to me in the remembrance of that evening; to resume my pen;
to work.",,
"Though Lydia had never
been a favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be
deeply affected.",,
"He did this so that nobody but I saw the file; and when he had done it
he wiped the file and put it in a breast-pocket. I knew it to be Joe’s
file, and I knew that he knew my convict, the moment I saw the
instrument. I sat gazing at him, spell-bound.",,
"It always gave me pain to observe that
Steerforth treated him with systematic disparagement, and seldom lost
an occasion of wounding his feelings, or inducing others to do so. This troubled me the more for a long time, because I had soon told
Steerforth, from whom I could no more keep such a secret, than I could
keep a cake or any other tangible possession, about the two old women
Mr. Mell had taken me to see; and I was always afraid that Steerforth
would let it out, and twit him with it.",,
"“Now, dear Victor, I dare say you wish to be indulged in a little
gossip concerning the good people of Geneva. The pretty Miss Mansfield
has already received the congratulatory visits on her approaching
marriage with a young Englishman, John Melbourne, Esq. Her ugly
sister, Manon, married M.",,
"‘Run away?’ I repeated. ‘Yes! From him,’ she said, with a laugh.",,
"“There, you suspicious brute,” she said, not sorry that Nana was in
disgrace. “They are perfectly safe, aren’t they? Every one of the
little angels sound asleep in bed.",,
"So having warned him out of London, I made
an afternoon of it to warn him to keep out of it now he WAS away, and
go farther from it, and maintain a bright look-out that I didn’t
catch him coming back again.”

“Poor creature!” said I. “Poor enough,” assented Mr. Bucket, “and trouble enough, and well
enough away from London, or anywhere else.",,
"‘What name?’ inquired the lady. ‘Copperfield, ma’am,’ I said. ‘That won’t do,’ returned the lady.",,
"He was about to take another bite, and had just got his head on
one side for a good purchase on it, when his eye fell on me, and he saw
that my bread and butter was gone. The wonder and consternation with which Joe stopped on the threshold of
his bite and stared at me, were too evident to escape my sister’s
observation. “What’s the matter _now_?” said she, smartly, as she put down her cup.",,
"Bagnet likewise bestows a good-humoured nod
and smile. “Now, George,” said Mrs. Bagnet briskly, “here we are, Lignum and
myself”—she often speaks of her husband by this appellation, on
account, as it is supposed, of Lignum Vitae having been his old
regimental nickname when they first became acquainted, in compliment
to the extreme hardness and toughness of his physiognomy—“just
looked in, we have, to make it all correct as usual about that
security.",,
"If you accept my service, you
will not repent it. Mademoiselle, you will not repent it, and I will
serve you well. You don’t know how well!”

There was a lowering energy in her face as she stood looking at me
while I explained the impossibility of my engaging her (without
thinking it necessary to say how very little I desired to do so),
which seemed to bring visibly before me some woman from the streets
of Paris in the reign of terror.",,
"Their limbs appear to have struck roots into their
breasts and bodies, as aged trees strike roots into the earth. Their
legs are so hard as to encourage the idea that they must have devoted
the greater part of their long and arduous lives to pedestrian
exercises and the walking of matches. But Mr.",,
"‘Never say die, sir! If She don’t smile upon you,
there’s a many as will. You are a young gentleman to be smiled on, Mr.",,
"Mr. Lorry was a pleasant sight too,
beaming at all this in his little wig, and thanking his bachelor
stars for having lighted him in his declining years to a Home. But, no
Hundreds of people came to see the sights, and Mr.",,
"My denying myself the
pleasure of the present agreeable conversation may not be wholly
irrespective of your own interests, Mr. C.”

Richard expressed himself quite sure of that and lighted Mr. Vholes
out.",,
"The time was come. I embraced him, took my weeping nurse upon my arm,
and hurried away. On deck, I took leave of poor Mrs.",,
"I asked Joe whether he had heard if any of the other
relations had any legacies? “Miss Sarah,” said Joe, “she have twenty-five pound perannium fur to
buy pills, on account of being bilious. Miss Georgiana, she have twenty
pound down.",,
"Where does he live?”

“Where he can, your worship,” replied the officer; again pretending to
receive Oliver’s answer. “Has he any parents?” inquired Mr. Fang.",,
"There was an indistinct talk of its being wet. I considered it frosty. Steerforth dusted me under a lamp-post, and put my hat into shape, which
somebody produced from somewhere in a most extraordinary manner, for
I hadn’t had it on before.",,
"“Really and truly.” And Charley, with
another short laugh of the purest glee, made her eyes very round
again and looked as serious as became my maid. I was never tired of
seeing Charley in the full enjoyment of that great dignity, standing
before me with her youthful face and figure, and her steady manner,
and her childish exultation breaking through it now and then in the
pleasantest way. “And where did you see her, Charley?” said I.",,
"I am afraid I was in a tremulous state for a minute
or so, though I did my best to disguise it. ‘There is nothing I can say, sir,’ I returned, ‘except that all the
blame is mine. Dora--’

‘Miss Spenlow, if you please,’ said her father, majestically.",,
"Micawber,
indefinitely kissing his hand and bowing with his genteelest air, ‘I do
Homage to Miss Wickfield! Hem!’ ‘I am glad of that, at least,’ said I. ‘If you had not assured us, my dear Copperfield, on the occasion of that
agreeable afternoon we had the happiness of passing with you, that D.",,
"I must go home.”

“Home!” repeated the young lady, with great stress upon the word. “Home, lady,” rejoined the girl. “To such a home as I have raised for
myself with the work of my whole life.",,
"Micawber now, and begged her to make use of me to any
extent. I began to dispose of the more portable articles of property
that very evening; and went out on a similar expedition almost every
morning, before I went to Murdstone and Grinby’s. Mr.",,
"He has shown neither patience nor impatience, nor attention
nor abstraction. He has shown nothing but his shell. As easily might
the tone of a delicate musical instrument be inferred from its case,
as the tone of Mr.",,
"Her face is too thin; her complexion has no
brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. Her nose wants
character; there is nothing marked in its lines. Her teeth are
tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which
have sometimes been called so fine, I never could perceive anything
extraordinary in them.",,
"Bagnet develops an exact system, sitting with every dish before
her, allotting to every portion of pork its own portion of
pot-liquor, greens, potatoes, and even mustard, and serving it out
complete. Having likewise served out the beer from a can and thus
supplied the mess with all things necessary, Mrs. Bagnet proceeds to
satisfy her own hunger, which is in a healthy state.",,
"‘Nothing,’ returned Mrs. Gummidge. ‘You’ve come from The Willing Mind,
Dan’l?’

‘Why yes, I’ve took a short spell at The Willing Mind tonight,’ said Mr.",,
"He was sorry
then. Very sorry.’

‘You went, I know, aunt.’

‘I went. I was with him a good deal afterwards.’

‘He died the night before we went to Canterbury?’ said I.",,
"“Mr. Bucket, my Lady.”

Mr. Bucket makes a leg and comes forward, passing his familiar demon
over the region of his mouth.",,
"Why,
don’t I know him!” cried Mrs. Bagnet. “Don’t I know you, George!",,
"“Lady Dedlock, the most disagreeable part of this business interview
remains, but it is business. Our agreement is broken. A lady of your
sense and strength of character will be prepared for my now declaring
it void and taking my own course.”

“I am quite prepared.”

Mr.",,
"Jorkins
would have his bond. The heart and hand of the good angel Spenlow would
have been always open, but for the restraining demon Jorkins. As I have
grown older, I think I have had experience of some other houses doing
business on the principle of Spenlow and Jorkins!",,
"I said, ‘You are a man of
business, I believe?’ He replied, ‘I am.’ ‘Very well,’ said I, ‘now
let us be business-like. Here is an inkstand, here are pens and
paper, here are wafers. What do you want?",,
"Estella returned, and she too
remained quiet. It seemed to me that we continued thus for a long time. In the heavy air of the room, and the heavy darkness that brooded in
its remoter corners, I even had an alarming fancy that Estella and I
might presently begin to decay.",,
"Have I the pleasure of addressing
another of the youthful parties in Jarndyce?” said the old lady,
recovering herself, with her head on one side, from a very low
curtsy. Richard, anxious to atone for his thoughtlessness of yesterday,
good-naturedly explained that Miss Jellyby was not connected with the
suit. “Ha!” said the old lady.",,
"Then,
the mender of roads having got his tools together and all things ready
to go down into the village, roused him. “Good!” said the sleeper, rising on his elbow. “Two leagues beyond the
summit of the hill?”

“About.”

“About.",,
"“It’s of no use hoping, though it’s very kind of you,” returned Miss
Jellyby, shaking her head. “Pa told me only yesterday morning (and
dreadfully unhappy he is) that he couldn’t weather the storm. I
should be surprised if he could.",,
"With all my whole heart, Esther!”

I told her, laughing, why I had known that, too, just as well as I
had known the other! And we sat before the fire, and I had all the
talking to myself for a little while (though there was not much of
it); and Ada was soon quiet and happy. “Do you think my cousin John knows, dear Dame Durden?” she asked.",,
"Jaggers. “Undoubtedly.”

“You consider it, undoubtedly, a handsome sum of money. Now, that
handsome sum of money, Pip, is your own.",,
"Painful recollections will
intrude, which cannot, which ought not to be repelled. I have been a
selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle. As a
child I was taught what was _right_, but I was not taught to correct my
temper.",,
"You
see, the path ain’t over light or cheerful arter dark; and when I’m
here at the hour as she’s a comin’ home, I puts the light in the winder. That, you see,’ said Mr. Peggotty, bending over me with great glee,
‘meets two objects.",,
"John, however, had held up his hand first. “Well, John?”

“May I sit in Peter’s chair, as he is not here?”

“Sit in father’s chair, John!” Wendy was scandalised. “Certainly not.”

“He is not really our father,” John answered.",,
"“Don’t be so
terrified, my love. I solemnly swear to you that I know of no harm
having happened to Charles; that I had no suspicion even of his being in
this fatal place. What prison is he in?”

“La Force!”

“La Force!",,
"It is so very difficult to keep her
from the door.”

Some neighbouring bells, reminding the poor soul that it was
half-past nine, did more for us in the way of bringing our visit to
an end than we could easily have done for ourselves. She hurriedly
took up her little bag of documents, which she had laid upon the
table on coming in, and asked if we were also going into court. On
our answering no, and that we would on no account detain her, she
opened the door to attend us downstairs.",,
"“There, there,
there! See now, see now! The best and the worst are known to you, now.",,
"The glance was instantaneous. It was a relief to have got free of the
room. He whistled on the dog, and walked rapidly away.",,
"Maylie,
and Rose, and Mrs. Bedwin, and the good doctor were with him: and Mr. Brownlow followed in a post-chaise, accompanied by one other person
whose name had not been mentioned.",,
"Mr. Chillip laid his head a little more on one side, and looked at my
aunt like an amiable bird. ‘The baby,’ said my aunt.",,
"Let it be
somewhere beyond reach; in some obscure life--or, better still, in some
obscure death. I wonder, if your loving heart will not break, you have
found no way of helping it to be still! I have heard of such means
sometimes.",,
"“We are
beginning to spin along with that old suit at last, I promise you.”

No wonder that I shook my head! “As you say, it’s not a pleasant subject.” Richard spoke with the
same shade crossing his face as before. “Let it go to the four winds
for to-night.",,
"I merely named the
time.”

“What’s time,” says Mrs. Snagsby, “to eternity?”

“Very true, my dear,” says Mr. Snagsby.",,
"It’s a capital house for study. As quiet as a
monastery, and almost as roomy. Leave him here.’

My aunt evidently liked the offer, though she was delicate of accepting
it.",,
"“Yet would you believe that it’s HIS name on
the door-plate?”

“His son’s name is the same, you know,” said I. “He wouldn’t let his son have any name if he could take it from him,”
returned the old lady. “Look at the son’s dress!” It certainly was
plain—threadbare—almost shabby.",,
"Copperfield seventy-two, sir, if it would be preferred. Next you,
sir.’

‘Of course it would be preferred,’ said Steerforth. ‘And do it at once.’
The waiter immediately withdrew to make the exchange.",,
"“—or next day, maybe,” the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly
as if nothing had happened. “How am I to get in?” asked Alice again, in a louder tone. “_Are_ you to get in at all?” said the Footman.",,
"“I’ll go round to the others in the course of the day and destroy the
notes,” said Wemmick; “it’s a good rule never to leave documentary
evidence if you can help it, because you don’t know when it may be put
in. I’m going to take a liberty with you. _Would_ you mind toasting
this sausage for the Aged P.?”

I said I should be delighted to do it.",,
"Frankenstein is modest; an excellent quality in a young man. Young men should be diffident of themselves, you know, M. Clerval: I was
myself when young; but that wears out in a very short time.”

"Bumble, I pay a good
deal towards the poor’s rates.”

“Hem!” said Mr. Bumble. “Well?”

“Well,” replied the undertaker, “I was thinking that if I pay so much
towards ’em, I’ve a right to get as much out of ’em as I can, Mr.",,
"Lorry. “Unsettled weather, a long journey, uncertain means of travelling, a
disorganised country, a city that may not be even safe for you.”

“My dear Charles,” said Mr. Lorry, with cheerful confidence, “you touch
some of the reasons for my going: not for my staying away.",,
"I did something--bowed, I suppose--and was all attention, when the other
sister struck in. ‘My sister Lavinia,’ said she ‘being conversant with matters of this
nature, will state what we consider most calculated to promote the
happiness of both parties.’

I discovered afterwards that Miss Lavinia was an authority in affairs
of the heart, by reason of there having anciently existed a certain Mr. Pidger, who played short whist, and was supposed to have been enamoured
of her.",,
"Say what I would, I could not unsay it. We were silent again, and remained so, until the Doctor rose and walked
twice or thrice across the room. Presently he returned to where his
chair stood; and, leaning on the back of it, and occasionally putting
his handkerchief to his eyes, with a simple honesty that did him more
honour, to my thinking, than any disguise he could have effected, said:

‘I have been much to blame.",,
"“I don’t know nothink.”

“My young friend,” says Chadband, “it is because you know nothing
that you are to us a gem and jewel. For what are you, my young
friend? Are you a beast of the field?",,
"“And what have you got, my dear?” said Fagin to Charley Bates. “Wipes,” replied Master Bates; at the same time producing four
pocket-handkerchiefs. “Well,” said the Jew, inspecting them closely; “they’re very good ones,
very.",,
"If our impulses were confined to hunger,
thirst, and desire, we might be nearly free; but now we are moved by
every wind that blows and a chance word or scene that that word may
convey to us. We rest; a dream has power to poison sleep. We rise; one wand’ring thought pollutes the day.",,
"Mr. Fang was consequently not a little indignant to see an unbidden guest
enter in such irreverent disorder. “What is this?",,
"I picture myself with my books shut up,
still listening to the doleful performance of Mr. Mell, and listening
through it to what used to be at home, and to the blowing of the wind
on Yarmouth flats, and feeling very sad and solitary. I picture myself
going up to bed, among the unused rooms, and sitting on my bed-side
crying for a comfortable word from Peggotty.",,
"The
ladies were as desperate as the gentlemen; indeed, I think they were
even more so. They threw themselves into committees in the most
impassioned manner and collected subscriptions with a vehemence quite
extraordinary. It appeared to us that some of them must pass their
whole lives in dealing out subscription-cards to the whole
post-office directory—shilling cards, half-crown cards,
half-sovereign cards, penny cards.",,
"There had been a coolness between myself
and Small on account of his being so close. But he said you and I
began it, and as he had me there—for we did—I put our acquaintance
on the old footing. That’s how I come to know what they’re up to.”

“You haven’t looked in at all?”

“Tony,” says Mr.",,
"Is not this as good a time as another for our knowing
more?”

“Well!” he said, after consideration. “You’re on your oath, you know,
Pip’s comrade?”

“Assuredly,” replied Herbert. “As to anything I say, you know,” he insisted.",,
"“You are, of course, the person who has written me so many letters?”

“Several, your ladyship. Several before your ladyship condescended to
favour me with an answer.”

“And could you not take the same means of rendering a Conversation
unnecessary? Can you not still?”

"When it’s moonlight, though?”

Oh, yes. When it’s moonlight! Of course.",,
"He forced back the gathering shadows of death, as
he forced his clenched right hand to remain clenched, and to cover his
wound. “‘Then, with that man’s permission and even with his aid, his
brother took her away; in spite of what I know she must have told his
brother--and what that is, will not be long unknown to you, Doctor, if
it is now--his brother took her away--for his pleasure and diversion,
for a little while. I saw her pass me on the road.",,
"I suppose
we were company to each other, without talking. I forgot to mention that
he would talk to himself sometimes, and grin, and clench his fist, and
grind his teeth, and pull his hair in an unaccountable manner. But he
had these peculiarities: and at first they frightened me, though I soon
got used to them.",,
"“Where is your sister?” said he hastily, as he opened the door. “With my mother upstairs. She will be down in a moment, I dare say.”

He then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good wishes
and affection of a sister.",,
"Let him say he was,
in so much as a word of one syllable, and I’ll either catch hold of his
throat and choke him for half a guinea;” Mr. Cruncher dwelt upon this as
quite a liberal offer; “or I’ll out and announce him.”

“Humph! I see one thing,” said Carton.",,
"It is quite a bower in the
summer-time. Where the birds sing melodiously. I pass the greater
part of the long vacation here.",,
"Bumble?” said the matron,
sipping her tea. “When, indeed, ma’am!” rejoined Mr. Bumble.",,
"Even these noises ceased. To Michael the loneliness was dreadful. “If
only something would make a sound!” he cried.",,
"Caddy, show Miss Clare and Miss
Summerson their rooms. You will like to make some change, perhaps? You will excuse me, I know, being so much occupied.",,
"Bucket’s own
words are “to come up to the scratch.”

This sparkling stranger is such a new and agreeable feature in the
evening that Mr. George, who testified no great emotions of pleasure
on his entrance, begins, in spite of himself, to be rather proud of
him. He is so friendly, is a man of so many resources, and so easy to
get on with, that it is something to have made him known there.",,
"You don’t object
to an aged parent, I hope?”

I really thought he was still speaking of the fowl, until he added,
“Because I have got an aged parent at my place.” I then said what
politeness required. “So, you haven’t dined with Mr. Jaggers yet?” he pursued, as we walked
along.",,

good-looking boy, that, my dear.”

she had to pass, in gaining the main thoroughfare. “Has it long gone the half-hour?” asked the girl. “It’ll strike the hour in another quarter,” said the man: raising his
lantern to her face.",,
"“Lovely, darling house,” Wendy said, and they were the very words they
had hoped she would say. “And we are your children,” cried the twins. Then all went on their knees, and holding out their arms cried, “O
Wendy lady, be our mother.”

“Ought I?” Wendy said, all shining.",,
"Lord strike you dead on the spot, if ever you split in
any way sumever! Kiss it!”

“Do so, as he wishes it,” I said to Herbert. So, Herbert, looking at me
with a friendly uneasiness and amazement, complied, and Provis
immediately shaking hands with him, said, “Now you’re on your oath, you
know.",,
"Blow the eye!” cries Mr. Weevle, cutting him short. “Say what
you have got to say!”

Finding his friend in this morose and material condition, Mr.",,
"“We must not say so, Dame Durden,” he cheerfully replied; “Ada is the
happier, I hope, and that is much. I did think that I and both these
young creatures might be friends instead of distrustful foes and that
we might so far counter-act the suit and prove too strong for it. But
it was too much to expect.",,
"“In a night-cap—”

“And hobbling with a couple of sticks!” cries Phil, still more
excited. “With a couple of sticks. When—”

“When you stops, you know,” cries Phil, putting down his cup and
saucer and hastily removing his plate from his knees, “and says to
me, ‘What, comrade!",,
"This gained upon me as we went along; so that the nearer we drew, the
more familiar the objects became that we passed, the more excited I was
to get there, and to run into her arms. But Peggotty, instead of sharing
in those transports, tried to check them (though very kindly), and
looked confused and out of sorts. Blunderstone Rookery would come, however, in spite of her, when the
carrier’s horse pleased--and did.",,

bed, I sat down to write my letter to the two old ladies.",,

sawyer that was put in the cage, miss, and they expect he’ll drink
himself to death entirely on beer,” said Charley. Not knowing what might be the matter, and being easily apprehensive
now, I thought it best to go to this place by myself. I bade Charley
be quick with my bonnet and veil and my shawl, and having put them
on, went away down the little hilly street, where I was as much at
home as in Mr.",,

“No. Where has there been a murder?”

remarked before. ‘Mr.",,

pale young gentleman, reaching out his hand good-humouredly, “it’s all
over now, I hope, and it will be magnanimous in you if you’ll forgive
me for having knocked you about so.”

I derived from this speech that Mr. Herbert Pocket (for Herbert was the
pale young gentleman’s name) still rather confounded his intention with
his execution. But I made a modest reply, and we shook hands warmly.",,
